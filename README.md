Rothamsted Research, with strategic funding from UKRI BBSRC, hosts three internationally renowned National Bioscience Research Infrastructures (NBRIs); the Rothamsted Long-Term Experiments (RLTEs), the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP) and the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS).They exist for the benefit of the scientific community in general and both their facilities and the open datasets they produce are freely available to researchers.
You can find more information on our three National Bioscience Research Infrastructures and their data on their respective web sites and in our summary documents.
